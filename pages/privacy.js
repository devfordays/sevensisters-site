            We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
            Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.
            Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
            Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
            Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
            Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Sites or Apps, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Sites or Apps over time.

            Offer Wall.

Such an offer wall may appear in our web application and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will leave our web application. A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account.
